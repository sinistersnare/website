Website
=======

This is the Flask-FlatPages app that powers sinistersnare.github.io

it uses Flask FlatPages, Frozen Flask, and Flask (obviously). 

Right now I just use `python site.py build` and then manually move the built files into my seperate `blog` dir which is in its own repo (sinistersnare/sinistersnare.github.io)



IM MAKING A CHANGE RIGHT NOW TO SHOW HOW GIT WORKS TO THEW!
