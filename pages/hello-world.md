Hello! I finally took some time to get a blog setup; and now I have my own website! I hope to post technical things, and who knows what else, but this will be exciting!

Maybe I could post about setting up this blog, or my work with Libgdx. Im also planning on posting a short tutorial on creating a game with Python using Libgdx (with the Jython interpreter), a sort of "Libgdx for Python developers". I really want to see game development thrive with Python, and i think that this is a great opportunity for such things. 

I was also thinking about making a wrapper around Libgdx in python, as to be more pythonic. This could be something big for python, definitely, if done right. 

I hope that I find time to post on this blog a lot, and lets see how this goes, going forward!
